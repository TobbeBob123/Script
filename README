This is a bunch of script. But the most important script is "TobbeOS.sh" and "fjernPakker.sh". TobbeOS is my whole and complete Xmonad with theme and Xmobar and FjernPakker is a script that remove program who can give TobbeOS.sh errors, fjernePakker.sh is important in EndeavourOS. 

HOW TO USE:

First you want to (git clone), the whole git clone command is: 
$ git clone https://github.com/TobbeBob123/Script.git

HOW TO USE SCRIPT:
you use script with using Terminal and (cd) in to the folder you created (Script)
the command:
$ cd Script/

and next you will run a script, then run this command:
$ ./the-name-of-the-script.sh
I want to run TobbeOS.sh, so my command will be:
$ ./TobbeOS.sh
the script is now running.
